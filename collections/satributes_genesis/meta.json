  "description": "We have created this collection as a way to give back to the space that has given us so much joy over the past few years. Ordinals make web3 fun again and as a token of appreciation for the builders, dreamers and founders still building in the space, we wanted to create something of historic significance and share it with those still most active in the space. \n\nThis 100 piece collection has been inscribed onto Vintage sats mined by Satoshi Nakamoto on Jan 13, 2009.
