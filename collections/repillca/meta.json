  "description": "Repillca is a not-so-thoughtful collection inspired by Twelvefold, a project by Yuga.\n\nA collection of 100 one-of-a-kind generative artworks. Each piece in this collection draws inspiration from the iconic 'pill' created by CFW, resulting in a thought-provoking exploration of form and design.",
